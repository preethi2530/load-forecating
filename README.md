# load-forecating
Short-term load forecasting is a time series prediction
problem, and it plays an important role in operation and
scheduling in the power system. In addition, load forecasting
also can provide much important information which could be
used for possible energy interchange with other utilities. Thus,
reliable STLF (short-term load forecasting) methods are
necessary in power system.
